The structure fields contain the following information:

       arena  The total amount of memory allocated by means other than
              mmap(2) (i.e., memory allocated on the heap).  This figure
              includes both in-use blocks and blocks on the free list.

       ordblks
              The number of ordinary (i.e., non-fastbin) free blocks.

       smblks The number of fastbin free blocks (see mallopt(3)).

       hblks  The number of blocks currently allocated using mmap(2).
              (See the discussion of M_MMAP_THRESHOLD in mallopt(3).)

       hblkhd The number of bytes in blocks currently allocated using
              mmap(2).

       usmblks
              This field is unused, and is always 0.  Historically, it
              was the "highwater mark" for allocated spaceâ€”that is, the
              maximum amount of space that was ever allocated (in
              bytes); this field was maintained only in nonthreading
              environments.

       fsmblks
              The total number of bytes in fastbin free blocks.

       uordblks
              The total number of bytes used by in-use allocations.

       fordblks
              The total number of bytes in free blocks.

       keepcost
              The total amount of releasable free space at the top of
              the heap.  This is the maximum number of bytes that could
              ideally (i.e., ignoring page alignment restrictions, and
              so on) be released by malloc_trim(3).
